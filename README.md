# That-s-Life-MP 
That's Life mirrors life events of people from going to college, raising a family, investing, buying a house, working, and retiring. 

The player decides what kind of life he wants to experience during the game. At the start of each round, the player press for a randomly generated number [1-10]. This determines the number of spaces he/she will advance throughout the board.

Unlike the usual board games, where there is only 1 path from start to end, **That's Life!**, at some areas along the way, present players with two options: (1) to continue moving forward, (2) choose (a maybe shorter) route.

### Goal
The goal of this game is for the Players to reach retirement as early as possible with the most saving at hand.
